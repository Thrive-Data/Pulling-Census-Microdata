# Pulling Census Microdata
This repository includes some sample code for pulling data from the Census Microdata using `tidycensus`. For more information on `tidycensus`, see [here](https://walker-data.com/tidycensus/).

## Why is this useful?
Organizations often need data for reporting and applying to grants as well as distributing resources and programming to those most in need. The US Census offers the most comprehensive data on socioeconomic and demographic variables at high level of geographic granularity and temporal coverage. This repository should offer some useful code for handling and makign use of this data.

## Who is this useful for?
This repository is likely most useful to data analysts working in the nonprofit space in Chicago and other major cities that are just getting started or need a quick refresher with `R`
